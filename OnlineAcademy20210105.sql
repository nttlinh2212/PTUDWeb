I will talk through examples of great poses, bad poses, and things to look for - all supported by images and assignments from the book. </p><p>It\'s the perfect precursor to <strong>Part 2</strong> of our posing series: \"The Ultimate Posing Flow\",&nbsp;which is a live photography studio session, showing you how to implement the poses with real models. Here we focus more on the \"do\'s\" than the \"don\'ts\"</p><p><br><strong>Why did I&nbsp;make this course?</strong></p><p>Whilst teaching workshops I realized that most of the attending photographers were really savvy about photography techniques and new technology but would freeze when they had to pose the Model or would run out of ideas very quickly. </p><p>Nine times out of ten we had the following scenario: </p><p>Student talking to the Model: <em>“Do this! Do something completely different! OK good, let’s go somewhere else”. </em><br>Me to the Student: <em>“Why don’t you finetune the pose or develop it further?” </em><br>Student: <em>“Well, I don’t know how….I don’t know anything about posing!”</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>So, that’s when I realized 2 things:</strong><br></p><p>First: It was time to write my own book about posing to really break things down as much as possible!</p><p>And Second: Why not also turn&nbsp;this book into a tutorial so I could demonstrate all those poses and scenarios? </p><p>Because THIS way my photography students could take the book with them to their shoots (for some guidance and reference) AND also watch me demonstrating all those poses (plus seeing overlaid images to understand even better why some poses work and some don’t)</p><p><strong>So, let me tell you a few things about “Posing Like A Pro”:</strong></p><p>In this course you will learn ALL the THEORY about posing STEP-BY-STEP. You will learn to design poses that flatter your Model and your Client. You will understand the importance of animating the Model’s body and why it’s critical to the <strong>Success of Storytelling</strong>. Being a great Portrait Photographer means being able to create memorable images continuously AND on the spot. And this is exactly the <strong>No. 1 WORRY</strong> for many new (and even intermediate) photographers: How can you guarantee your Model or Clients these amazing images, that make them look like a million dollars - time after time after time?&nbsp;(And without that you need to freak out!)&nbsp;</p><p><strong>This is why you will learn the following:','2021-01-20 10:00:00','2021-01-05 01:10:54',0),(10,'Sales Training: Practical Sales Techniques',2,0,1,0,0,0,100000,300000,3,14,4,'2020-12-10 21:30:04',1,'Sales Hacking: Essential sales skills, sales strategies and sales techniques to sell just about anything!','<p><strong>Sales Training: Practical Sales Techniques</strong></p><p><em>Sales Hacking: Essential sales skills, sales strategies and sales techniques to sell just about anything!</em></p><p><br></p><p>Sales is all about listening to people and prescribing a solution.
